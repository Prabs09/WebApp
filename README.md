# WebApp
This is a basic program for understanding the working of java servlets, jsp, jdbc, ServletConfig.

A user will login and pass using his credentials and when user logs in they will be able to view their information.

If a user is not registered they can register themselves by clicking the register button and create their own user and pass.

This project helps to understand how a user data can be saved in a database with the help of JDBC and can be presented to user in jsp file.

A lot of things can be added in this project like user login session, updating records, deleting records, and show data in a more presentable way. 
If anyone want to add the above said feature in this they can contribute in it and i will add it in this project.
